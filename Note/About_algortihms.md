# Standard discrete problems
+ what is it?
  + Polynomial
  + Exponential 
    + NP-hard (Nondeterministic Polynomial time)

# General algortihm design
+ Define
  + how to define a problem ? any case ? 
    + 
+ translate into a problem that is well known.
  + what types of problems are well known?
+ for the non-standard parts, ue standard algorithm design techinique.

# Main discrete algorithm design techiniques
+ Divide and conquer.
+ dynamic programming: solve a sequence of subproblems until you get to your problem.
+ Greedy algorithm/heuristic
  + Do what seems best in every step. Is often heuristic.
+ Combinatorial search.
  + Test all possibilites or subest of them. Use branch and bound to speed up ? (how and maybe for an example?)

+ Local search
  + something like LM optimiazation ? take a solution and repeatedly improve it by making small changes.
