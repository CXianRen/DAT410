### What should we do for each question!
+ try to characterize each problem
  + what does "characterize" means? 
  + how to characterize a problem ?
    + try to descrip a problem belonging to which type of problem: like classification, regression, clustering, etc. 
    + what are the input and expected output?
    + can it be modelled as : linear model ? NN model? Decision tree?
    + what are the constraints ? resource ? time ? or what else?
    + will it change dynamically over time?
    + how could we evaluate the result ?
+ how it can be modelled.
+ (as appropriate) consider possible ways to solve.
