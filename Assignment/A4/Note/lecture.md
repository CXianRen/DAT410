# Diagnostic Systems

+ Early AI in medicine: Expert system
  + use logic for inference based on a knowledge base


## What is diagnostics?
+ the task of finding out the cause of some phenomenon. 

+ this conceptual problem exists in many domains:
  + software debugging 
  + reasons for user churn
  + failure investigation (anything from cars to infrasturctre)

+ based on data of the patient "irrespective of computational aids"


+ diagnostic criteria specify combinations of signs, symptoms and tests that are used to determine diagosis.

+ Types of medical diagnostics
  + Clinical diagnosis
    + based on signs and symptoms
  + laboratory diagnosis
    + based on tests,
  + radiology diagnosis
    + based on imaging, X-ray, CT

### Model-based tests

#### A simple model: Naive Bayes
assuming that symptoms are conditionally independent.!!!

Benefits:
  + the probalilities of symptoms given disease, $p(X_j|D)$ can be readily estimated from data-from subjects who were diagnosed.
  + For discrete symptoms, it can be done using a table!
  + naturally handles missingness in the measurments of symptoms/observations $X_j$
